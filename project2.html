            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            
            <p>React is a leading library for building user interfaces. Deploying a React application is a crucial aspect of web development. Docker and Nginx provide a popular solution for this deployment.</p>

            <h2>Why Docker and Nginx?</h2>
            
             <p><b>Docker:</b> An open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It packages an application and its environment into a container.
                <br><b>Nginx:</b> A high-performance web server used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.</p>
                <br>
                Combining Docker and Nginx creates a portable and scalable deployment solution for React applications.

           
            <h3>Stage 1: Create a Dockerfile</h3>
            
                <p>The Dockerfile contains instructions to build a Docker image of the React application. It involves two stages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Building the React application
                        </li>
                        <li>Serving it from Nginx</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h3>Stage 2: Build the Docker Image:</h3>
            
                <p>Use the Docker build command to create a new Docker image from the Dockerfile.</p>
            
                <h3>Stage 3: Run the Docker Container:</h3>
            
                <p>Use the Docker run command to create a new Docker container from the image. The Nginx server inside the container serves the React application on port 80.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            
                <p>By following these steps, a React application can be efficiently hosted on an Nginx server inside a Docker container. This ensures a smooth deployment process and provides the benefits of containerization such as improved scalability and easier management.</p>
